In order to start the program, you have to change the input_path variable in Start_procedure.py to the path of your folder, where the HTML-files from EPSD2 are saved.

The resulting file is called "EPSD_in Ontolex.olex" and is saved in the same directory as the program files are.  

If there is an issue during the handling of the html-files, the file names and the total number of files, where an error occured, are printed in the console.

The file "EPSD_in_Ontolex.zip" consists of my finished model of the EPSD2-dictionary
